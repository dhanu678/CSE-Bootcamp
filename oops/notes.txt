OOPS-
    from today whenever you create a folder, use the naming convenction/rules of the variables.

package -
    fancy name given to a folder
    use of making a package - to differendiate between two classes having the same name

    pattern-questions  ----- X
    patternQuestion -------- right way
    pattern_question ----------right way


classes and objects - 
    class - 

primitive datatype - 
    byte - 0
    short - 0
    int - 0
    long - 0
    float - 0.0
    double - 0.0
    boolean - false
    char - ' ';

Reference/complex datatype
    array - null
    string - null


Constructor - It is used to assignvalues to our variables

class components - what all things we can write inside our class

variables
    - instance/ non-static variables    
    - static variable
    - local variable

methods/functions
    - instance/non-static methods
    - static method

constructor
    - default
    - non-parameterized/ zero parameterized
    - parameterized

blocks
    - instance block
        - It will get executed as many times as we create the object of that class
        - object mandatory
    - static block
        - It will get executed only once whenever the class is loaded
        - class loading is mandatory

    order of execution -
        static block
        instance block
        constructor

nested class/inner class


OOPS pillars - 
    1. encapsulation - done
    2. inheritance
    3. polymorphism
    4. abstraction


encapsulation - 
technical - making the variables as private and access those varaiables using public getters and setters
hiding the data, wrapping the data and method together.
For data validation we use encapsulation.

setter/constructor - to set the values of private variables

inheritance - using the properties and methods from the parent class 

types of inheritance - 
    1. single
    2. multilevel
    3. Hierarchical
    4. Multiple  - not possible in java
    5. Hybrid    - not possible in java



The first line of every default constructor is super call super();
